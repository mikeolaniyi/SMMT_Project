The Social Media Management Tool Project was a research I carried out to generate a report for my team with regards to the SMMT project we were developing at the time Called Synkify. This software was designed to help businesses integrate all their Social media on one user interface. 

The dataset of this project was a collection of data from web research. The analysis was done in Excel and visualization was done in Tableau.

This analysis enabled us to know how many SMMT are there in the World, their features, their cost, how many social media platforms can be integrated, etc.
