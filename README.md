The Social Media Management Tool Project was a research endeavour I conducted to produce a report containing actionable insights for my team regarding the Social Media Management Tool project we were developing. This project, known as Synkify, aimed to facilitate businesses in integrating all their social media platforms within a unified user interface. The ultimate goal was to enhance interactions between businesses and customers, optimizing their effectiveness. 

The dataset of this project was a collection of data from web research. The analysis was done in Excel and visualization was done in Tableau.

This analysis enabled us to know how many SMMT are there in the World, their features, their cost, how many social media platforms can be integrated, etc.
